# How to run it

uv run python main.p

The recommended approach for building agents, especially for more complex and robust applications, is to migrate to LangGraph and utilize langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent.

Reasons for moving to LangGraph and create_react_agent:

* Enhanced Control Flow: LangGraph's graph-based architecture provides more granular control over the agent's decision-making process and execution flow.

* Built-in Persistence: LangGraph offers built-in mechanisms for managing agent state and memory, which is crucial for long-running and conversational agents.

* Multi-Actor Workflows: LangGraph is designed to handle more sophisticated scenarios involving multiple agents interacting and collaborating.

* Prebuilt Components: create_react_agent simplifies the creation of ReAct-style agents, a powerful framework for combining language model reasoning with tool usage.
